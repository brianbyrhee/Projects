# CS61A Summer 2018: Ants
A little project I did in Summer 2018 when I took a class at UC Berkeley. 

## About
This project is inspired off of EA's Plants vs Zombies, or just any tower defense game in general. Protect the Queen Ant from the Bees!

This project takes advantage of inheritance and classes while using colorful gifs and images to implement a simple frontend .

# CS61A Summer 2018: Maps
A little project I did in Summer 2018 when I took a class at UC Berkeley. 

## About
By using a given a Yelp dataset of reviews of restaurants at Berkeley, I use basic supervised and unsupervised learning ML techniques such as least-squares linear regression and k-means clustering, respectively, to build a visualization of the restuarants in the neighborhood.

In addition, you can use `recommend.py` and custom input queries and existing personal Yelp review data to output a local host visualization that recommends restaurants that you haven't been to and predicts your ratings
